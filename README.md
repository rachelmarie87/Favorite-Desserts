# Favorite-Desserts
Repository for Rachel's Favorite Desserts

This R project includes information about my favorite desserts. It has my ratings of the desserts, along with the amount of each dessert that I could consume. The consumption amount is listed in ounces and is the maximum amount I could eat in one sitting, assuming I hadn't eaten any other desserts
This information was put into excel, saved as .csv file and then imported into R project. 
I changed the name of column "ratiing" to "rating" to fix a spelling error. 
I used ggplot2 to create a bar graph, showing my dessert data. I changed the name of the legend in order to make it more clear. 
The bar graph shows the type of desssert on the x-axis, my rating for the dessert on the y-axis, and the color of the bars in the graph indicate the quantity.
